# Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma

Inspired by 3b1b's [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Jl0dxWQs8).

The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma states that a set of high-dimensional points can be embedded into a low-dimensional space while preserving the pairwise distances of points.

Essentially, high dimensional spaces can hold exponentially more nearly perpendicular vectors.
